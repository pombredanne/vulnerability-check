# CVE Details Retrieval and Processing

This repository contains two Python scripts for retrieving and processing Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) data using the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) API, and storing the data in a SQLite database.

## File Descriptions

- `import_cve_db.py`: This script allows you to download CVE JSON files from the NVD API and extract the data. It downloads the files for a specified range of years, saves them locally, and extracts the JSON data for further processing. After that, the script imports the extracted CVE data from the JSON files into a SQLite database. It creates a new SQLite database file, creates a table for storing the CVE details, and inserts the data into the table.
- `vul_check.py`: This script allows you to check CVE detail from list (in csv file) and save the result into another csv file.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Requests library (can be installed via `pip install requests`)

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the two Python files (`download_cve_file.py` and `import_cve_to_db.py`) to your local machine.

2. Ensure you have the necessary prerequisites installed.

3. **Step 1: Download CVE Files**

   - Open the `import_cve_db.py` file and modify the `start_year` and `end_year` variables to specify the range of years for which you want to download the CVE files.

   - Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the `import_cve_db.py` file.

   - Run the following command to download the CVE files:

     ```shell
     python import_cve_db.py
     ```

   - The script will download the ZIP files for the specified years, extract the JSON files, and save them in a `cve-db` folder within the current directory.

   - Run the following command to import the CVE data to the SQLite database:

     ```shell
     python import_cve_to_db.py
     ```

   - The script will create a new SQLite database file named `cve_data.db`, create a table to store the CVE details, and import the data from the JSON files into the database.

4. **Step 2: Process CVE File and Retrieve Details**

   - Open the `vul_check.py` file.

   - Modify the `input_file` and `output_file` variables to specify the input CSV file containing the list of CVE IDs and the desired output CSV file for saving the CVE details.

   - Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the `vul_check.py` file.

   - Run the following command to process the CVE file and retrieve the details:

     ```shell
     python vul_check.py
     ```

   - The script will read the input CSV file, retrieve the CVE details from the SQLite database, and save them to the output CSV file.

5. Verify that the CVE details have been saved to the output CSV file specified in Step 2.

That's it! You have successfully retrieved and processed CVE data using the provided Python scripts.

Feel free to explore and modify the scripts according to your specific requirements.
